# Data Science Programming assignments from course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

Following topics were implemented in the individual assignments:

1. Data preprocessing, Brier score, AUC
2. kNN clustering, NaiveBayes
3. Decision trees, Decision Forests
3. *Project:* Activity prediction for chemical compounds: We developed a predictive model, using a training set with 19 125 chemical compounds represented by SMILES together with their activity label (0 = inactive, 1 =active) w.r.t. some biological activity. Using a suitable representation (feature set) and learning algorithm, we aimed to maximize the area under ROC curve (AUC) on the test set (for which we were not given the labels). Our team had one of the most accurate predictions for the test set in the course competition.
